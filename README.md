# CompArch---prog-8
I initially designed the Tinker CPU as a multi-cycle system, executing each instruction sequentially across multiple clock cycles, which was simple but slow for programs like the Fibonacci test case. To enhance performance, I transitioned to a 5-stage pipelined architecture (IF, DE, EX, MEM, WB), enabling concurrent instruction processing to reduce execution time. This required adding pipeline registers to store intermediate data, implementing forwarding to resolve data hazards, and incorporating a hazard detection unit to stall for load-use hazards. The pipelined design significantly improved throughput, executing 100 instructions in approximately 104 cycles.
